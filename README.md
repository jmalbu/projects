# Wonderland
Repository for the interactive fiction (IF) choice-based game I developed as a project for COMP110. The game is designed to be a sequel to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In it you encounter all the most iconic characters from the original story, fight evil creatures, and collect objects.
